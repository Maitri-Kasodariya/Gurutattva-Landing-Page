            <p className='intro'>
                <b>Himalayan Meditation</b> is not a technique — it’s a return to your true self.<br /><br />
                Rooted in an ancient Himalayan tradition, this simple yet profound practice invites you to sit in silence, surrender your thoughts, and connect with the universal energy of the <b>Guru Tattva</b>. With no rituals, mantras, or postures, it’s a pure journey inward — where transformation unfolds naturally, effortlessly.<br /><br />
                Passed down from enlightened Himalayan masters and revived for the modern world by <b>Shree Shivkrupanand Swamiji</b>, this path offers deep peace, emotional clarity, and a direct experience of stillness within.
